## Question 5

In your own words, please answer the following question: WHAT IS THE DOM?

<!-- your answer starts here -->
The DOM is a way of accessing items in html using the object model.
It treates all part of the html in a page as an object, with the largest object being the document itself.  It helps you to then be able to change objects within the page using this obejct model.
