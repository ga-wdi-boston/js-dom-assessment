## Question 2

Using the diagram in the `README` file, what are two ways you could return ALL
list items (`li`) using jQuery? This is intentionally vague. (Assume starting
at the `OL` DOM node).

<!-- your answer starts here -->
$('li')
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 3

Write the jQuery code to navigate from one of the list item (`li`) DOM nodes to
the `form` DOM node. (Assume the list item has a class of "listerItem").

<!-- your answer starts here -->
$( "li.listerItem" ).parent().sibling("form");
<!-- your answer ends here -->

## Question 4

Give two examples of jQuery getter methods and two examples of jQuery setter
methods.

<!-- your answer starts here -->
$("li.listerItem").html is a getter
$("li.listerItem").html("Listed item") is a setter
$("#loginform").text() is a getter
$("button").class("#redbutton") is a setter (I think, maybe I did this wrong?)
